# Perceptron

NAI - Artificial Intelligence Tools

Course Assignment

This program is my implementation of Perceptron algorithm with numerical/Iris flower dataset .

## How to Run?

* *Run Code*

You can decide to run program on test file or your own input data as well as numerical or Iris data
### Running through the test file:
* *Enter name of the train file:* 

for Iris
```
train.txt
```

for Numerical
```
train2.txt
```

* *Enter name of the test file:* 

for Iris
```
test.txt
```

for Numerical
```
test2.txt
```

* *Enter learning rate*
* *Enter iteration number*

### Running through your own input:
* *Enter 4 characteristics of a flower(Ex. 4.5,3.6,2.5,4.6)*
* *Enter name of your flower*
* *Enter name of the train file* 
* *Enter learning rate*
* *Enter iteration number*
